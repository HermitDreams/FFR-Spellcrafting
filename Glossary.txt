*** Note about Poison Status ***

Black Magic can inflict Poisons but they have no effect on enemies
To make them useful to players, a secondary debuff is always added on top
Poisons come in 4 different elements: Poison, Time, Death, and Fire
They will pretend to be a Poison-element variant of the secondary debuff

Recent Changes:

- Rebalanced accuracy mods to align debuff spells with vanilla
- Tweaked Instadeath, Earth, and Poison to buff the elements and nerf the instadeath
- Renamed XALL to XPOS and PURG
- Renamed FRGD to BRRR
- Renamed RINK to FLOE
- Renamed GROU to OHM
- Added Power Word "FROG" to White Magic
- Flagstring now recognizes "r". Does nothing yet.
- Flagstring prepped to recognize "L". Will output a log file (barely started).

- HRM4 at 8 (or 100 damage) is now VANQ
- Extended accuracy cap
- Changed accuracy range from 0-107 to 0-255 (only affects No Level Balancing)

- Elemental damage spell accuracy nerfed (Levels 1 and 2 fall in line with vanilla, Level 8 doesn't exceed NUKE)
- DUAL, ELEM, and FLAR are now HYDR, ATOM, and GYSR respectively
- Antipode damage buffed (was x1.1, now x1.5)
- Non-Toxic Poison debuffs now use the White palette like Stone does
- Option "x" is under construction (removes level balancing, uses first prototype's random ranges, tiers based on heirarchy)

Possible changes:

- Buff accuracy of single-target damage spells?
- Greatly buff accuracy of elemental non-damaging spells?
 - Exclude LOCK/SLEP/SLOW, meaning they get the huge buff even when non-elemental

Should I invest time in a new assignment method?
- Would be based on selecting entire families
- Accuracy would be based on family instead of slot level

A "mystery" variant where the spells have non-descript names
- "W1-2", "B3-4", etc. Figure out what they do by having them used against you or test buying
- Some slots aren't used by any enemies at all and are always gambles
- Would only use Accuracy Scaled By Slot Level, so a Level 1 is probably not worth the purchase


NAMING CONVENTIONS

=Level Balanced= (Default)

A spell will shorten and get its tier tacked on at the end if it has a changing Power Value.
However, anything without one will not label its tier, and thus only the lowest level can exist.

Example: TMPR and TMP2 can coexist in different tiers, one at Lv1 and another at Lv3
Example: BRAK will not become BRK3 if it rolls vanilla Level 7, and cannot create a copy if it first rolled at Lv2.
Example: FIRE at Level 5 will be FIR3, regardless of whether FIRE and FIR2 exist or not.

=Unbalanced=

Spells will get tiered based on how many of that type exist.
Power takes precedence over Accuracy.
Furthermore, damage spells of at least 80 Power and 64 Accuracy will get their Lv8 name. The highest damage gets the name and the others become regularly tiered names.

Example: FIRE, ICE, and ICE2 roll. FIRE can be 70 Damage and 45 Accuracy, while ICE2 can be 30 Damage and 10 Accuracy as ICE is 25 Damage and 60 Accuracy.
Example: BRK2 exists because the Single-Target Poison Stone rolled twice, and BRK2 has higher Accuracy than BRAK.
Example: While NECR has 85 Damage and 100 Accuracy, DOOM takes the name because it has 100 Damage and 85 Accuracy.


FORMULAS

=Accuracy=

Accuracy is tiered based on the accuracies used across spells and skills in vanilla.
A spell's accuracy is altered based on its starting level, effect, target, and element.
Outside of level balancing, a spell simply keeps its "starting roll" value between 0 and 255.

Tiers: 0, 5, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 107, 128, 152, 175, 210
- Any tier above 107 was made up by finding good benchmarks.
- A spell's "starting roll" of 0, 1, or 148 will set it to 255 in default settings
 - Instakill, Stone, and Paralyze will not get this effect.

Starting Levels:
- Level 1: 16
- Level 2 (Raw Damage): 16
- Level 2 to Level 4 (anything else): 24
- Level 5 to Level 7: 40
- Level 8: 64

Accuracy Mods (in Tiers):

Single Target: +1
Sleep: +1 at Level 1, +3 afterward
Lock, Mute, Confuse: +4
Stun: +3 if elemental (except Time), -2 if non-elemental
Slow: +4 if elemental, only +1 if non-elemental
Xfer: +1 if under Level 8, and +2 if elemental
Cross-Class Debuff: -2 penalty
Earth and Poison: +2
Non-elemental or Species-targetting Damage: +1
Instakill: -2
Stone: -1
Time and Death: -1

Example: ERAD at Lv1 goes from 16 down to 0 (-3 Tiers)
Example: LOCK at Lv8 Black goes from 64 to 152 (+3 Tiers)
Example: QAKE at Lv6 stays at 40 (+1, -1), BANE at Level 5 is the same, BRAK at 7 goes from 40 to 64 (Stone is not Dead)

These maintain a few key vanilla values. Others fall on the wayside and need to be addressed later.


=Damage=
Power: MagicLevel*10. Level 8 is 100, single target boosts to 120 to compensate for maxed accuracy
- ROT4 didn't overflow accuracy so it doesn't get an extra boost
Tiers: Tier 2 starts at L3, Tier 3 starts at L5
Rules:
- Black gets access to (order of rarity)
-- Fire, Ice, Lit
-- Poison
-- Death
-- Antipode, Plasma, Storm, Magma, Kinetic
- White gets access to Status, Stone, Time, Earth
- Pure Black/White are explicitly chosen less often
- All White Damage gets 20% power penalty
- Harm Undead gets +1 to Level (Lv7 is still 80) and voids the White penalty
- Antipode, Magma, and Kinetic get a 25% damage boost for being resisted by a lot
-- Any resistance to Fire or Ice cuts the damage in half
-- A weakness will boost it up to 75% total
-- In Improved Vanilla, this can be observed on WzVamps after they cast AFIR
-- Tier 4 Single Target caps at 150 damage
-- Plasma and Storm only get a 10% boost because Lightning isn't resisted often
--- Might drop Kinetic to 10% boost for the same reason

=Healing=
CURE Line: 2^(3.5 + MagicLevel/2) + (MagicLevel - 1)/2
HEAL Line: 6 * 2^(MagicLevel/2 - 0.5)
RGEN Line: rand(1.8,2.2)^(rand(2.5,4.0) + MagicLevel/2) + (MagicLevel - 1)/2
** Need to get more data on RGEN's formula
Tiers: Cure's Tiers 2 & 3 are at L3 and L5, Heal's Tiers 2 & 3 are at L5 and L7

=Armor Up=
Self Tiers: 16 -> 24 -> 32 -> 64
Gift Tiers:  8 -> 12 -> 16 -> 24

=Evade Up=
Self Tiers: 60 -> 80 -> 120 -> 240
Gift Tiers: 30 -> 40 -> 60 -> 80

=Weapons Stronger=
TMPR: MagicLevel*3 + rand(3,5)
SABR: 2^(1.5 + MagicLevel/2) + (9 - MagicLevel) + MagicLevel/2
RALY: TMPR/((rand(10.0,12.0) - MagicLevel)/2) + 5
** Needs tweaking. TMPR too strong
** The +5 in RALY and the (9-MagicLevel) in SABR need more testing

=Weapon Enchant=
Vanilla SABR shows up at Lv8. Is that too late?

=Evade Down=
Level*20, White gets +0, +40, or +80 at Lv8.
Black gets a random number between 160 and 240 at Lv8

=Morale Down=
(Level+1)*5, modified Lv8 goes up to 64

=General Rules=
- Death gets +20% Power to Damage and Fear
- White uses Status, Time, Earth, and None for everything
- Black's selection depends on the effect itself

- White prefers Buffs and Healing over Debuffs
- Black prefers Debuffs over Buffs
- Only 5 different resist types can occupy a single spell list
-- Furthermore, their total message length can't exceed 60 chars

- WARP and EXIT are never replaced

=Sanity Checks=

These are all optional quality of life toggles

b: Black Spellbombs
Ensures that at least 6 Black AoE Damage spells exist in the list

b2: Damage Preservation
Ensures all original damage spells are still damage spells with that target
Exceptions:
- Extra damage spells can still be added
- NUKE's slot doesn't have to be AoE

C: Confusion
Ensures that the FIRE slot is a detrimental effect

e: Enemy Spells
Ensures all spell slots used by enemies will not be occupied by:
- JUDG or HARM
- LIFE or SOFT
- Lower Morale
- Confusion (except Poison)

h: Healing Out of Battle
Does not replace nor attempt to duplicate the following spells:
- CURE and HEAL families
- PURE
- LIFE
- SOFT
- LIF2

i: Item Magic
Ensures that the following spell types exist to assign each item:
- 2 Black AoE Damages that aren't already assigned (Mage Staff, Black Shirt)
- 1 White AoE Damage (Light Axe)
- 1 White AoE Healing (Heal Helm/Staff)
- 1 AoE Lightning (Thor/Zeus)
- 1 AoE Poison (Bane Sword)
- 1 Single Target Armor, Evade, or Resist (Defense)
- 1 Whole Party Armor, Evade, or Resist (White Shirt)
- 1 Speed Up, Power Up, or Enchant (Power Glove)
- 1 Black AoE Debuff (Wizard Staff)

Mage Staff starts seeking at Level 3
Black Shirt starts seeking at Level 4
Light Axe starts seeking at Level 3
Heal Helm/Staff start seeking at Level 3
Thor/Zeus start seeking at Level 3
Bane Sword starts seeking at Level 5
Defense starts seeking at Level 3
White Shirt starts seeking at Level 3
Power Glove starts seeking at Level 6
Wizard Staff starts seeking at Level 5

All start seeking forward first, then backward.

L: Fixed Lock Spells
Ensures that the LOK2 slot stays in the Evade Down family

x: Lawless Power
Uses single-spell damage and accuracy values with no regard for level
- In the future, spells will be tiered based on heirarchy, not innate strength
- This is under a lot of construction and scrutiny

(To Do) r: Reassign Permissions
Extrapolates from vanilla's permissions to balance out Red Mages
- Knight and Ninja get the same permissions as Red Wizard
-- Without Magic Shop Shuffle on, Knight caps at Level 3 and Ninja caps at Level 4
-- With Magic Shop Shuffle on, they simply lose out on anything tiered 3 or higher.
--- They also gain access to Travel spells
- Red Mage CAN access
-- Fire, Ice, Lightning, Status
-- Time, if Single Target
-- Per-level scaled families up to Level 5
-- Per-tier scaled families up to Level 4
- Red Mage can NOT access
-- Poison, Stone, Death, Earth, Dual-Elemental, Non-Elemental
-- Time, if AoE
-- Instakill, Undead, Lower Morale, and Power words
-- Buff Self/Party at Level 3 and beyond (except Resist)
-- Revive, Soften, CureAll, Max Health
-- Heal, if AoE
-- Resist, if Stacked
-- Anything Level 6 through 8
- Red WIZARD alleviates restrictions
-- Access to Level 6 and 7
-- Poison, Time, Earth, and Dual-Elemental
-- Non-Elemental, if Single Target
-- CHOK and BANE
-- Buff Self/Party up to Level 4
-- Buff Single Tier 3
-- Revive and CureAll, if Tier 1
-- Stacked Resists
- White Mage can NOT access
-- Tier 4 Spells
-- CLRa, SANC, LIF2, RUS3, BUK3
-- Level 8 Magic
- Black Mage can NOT access
-- Tier 4 Spells
-- BRAK and WREK at Level 5 and beyond
-- PETR, XXXX, SAB3, FURY
-- Level 8 Magic
